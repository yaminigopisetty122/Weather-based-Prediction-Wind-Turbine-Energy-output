WEATHER BASED PREDICTION OF WIND TURBINE POWER GENERATION


1. INTRODUCTION


The increasing demand for renewable energy has made wind power one of the most reliable and clean energy sources. Wind turbine power generation is highly dependent on weather conditions such as wind speed, air density, temperature, and pressure. Accurate prediction of wind turbine power output helps in efficient energy management, grid stability, and optimal utilization of wind resources.


This project focuses on predicting wind turbine power generation based on real-time and historical weather data using Machine Learning techniques. The system uses weather parameters to estimate the expected energy output of a wind turbine.


2. OBJECTIVE


The main objectives of this project are:
• To analyze weather data affecting wind turbine performance
• To predict wind turbine power output using machine learning
• To build a user-friendly web application for prediction
• To assist renewable energy planning and decision-making


3. PROBLEM STATEMENT


Wind energy generation is highly variable due to changing weather conditions. Manual estimation of wind turbine output is inefficient and inaccurate. There is a need for an automated system that can predict wind turbine power generation using weather data with good accuracy.
