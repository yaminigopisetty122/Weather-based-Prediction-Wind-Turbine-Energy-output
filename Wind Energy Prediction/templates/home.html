Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the
supply of energy worldwide. This trend will continue because global energy demand is
increasing, and the use of nuclear power and traditional sources of energy such as coal
and oil is unsafe and leads to a large amount of CO2 emission. Wind energy is a key 
player in the field of renewable energy. In Europe, the capacity of wind energy 
production has doubled from 2009 to 2010.

However, levels of production of wind energy are hard to predict as they rely on
potentially unstable weather conditions present at the wind farm. In particular, wind 
speed is crucial for energy production based on wind, and it may vary drastically over
time. Energy suppliers are interested in accurate predictions, as they can avoid
overproduction by coordinating the collaborative production of traditional power
plants and weather-dependent energy sources. The energy can be predicted based on
the power curve and the windspeed.
